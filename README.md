# http-request-logger

A simple set of php scripts to log http requests, view the log and clear the log. 

Very quick and dirty as we needed it to work right now. 

Useful to see what's happening when you're working with webhooks and things to see what the actual requests look like. 

Only logging GET and POST for now.
